      CS 335 Final Project
      Implements Pokemon SafariZone Game
                
		Known bugs: One frame flicker about five seconds into game start-up. Non-critical buffering issue.
		Note 1:	"Story" mode is not implemented. Only the step condition is implemented since only one condition
				is needed for iteration one.
		Note 2: A .classpath is included to ensure that art sprites are in the correct build path of eclipse projects.
				If a user encounters any exceptions related to art files, make sure it is added to the build path as a source folder.
				Also, macs might have problems playing .wav files?
		TODO: Battle GUI
